#### Some scripts for managing NASA JPL ECOSTRESS files
---
* **download-ecostress.sh**: download h5 files after staging through Earthdata
* **datelist.sh**: get a list of observations date/times from ECOSTRESS filenames
* **ECOSTRESS_swath2grid.py**: this is an old version of the swath2grid script to which I've added different resampling options ([get the latest offical version here](https://git.earthdata.nasa.gov/projects/LPDUR/repos/ecostress_swath2grid/browse))
