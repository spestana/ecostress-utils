#### Some scripts for managing NASA JPL ECOSTRESS files
---
* **download-ecostress.sh**: download h5 files after staging through Earthdata
* **datelist.sh**: get a list of observations date/times from ECOSTRESS filenames
* [**ECOSTRESS_swath2grid.py**](https://github.com/spestana/ECOSTRESS_swath2grid): Also see this (2019) version of the swath2grid script to which I've added different resampling options ([to get the latest offical version here](https://git.earthdata.nasa.gov/projects/LPDUR/repos/ecostress_swath2grid/browse))
